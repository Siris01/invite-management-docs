## Where is said data stored?

Periodic backups are taken as a safety precaution to prevent data loss or corruption. If you wish to enquire about the bot's current hosting provider, you may do so by contacting us at our [support server](https://discord.gg/uXbczw9aax).  

As for third-party services, we cannot guarantee where the data is stored therefore we are unable to guarantee data will not be processed and/or stored in certain locations.

## Do you sell or share said data?

**No**, we do not sell or share any data collected by Invite Management. 

## How long is said data stored?

Information such as invite links are stored only in-memory, meaning that they are lost when the bot restarts. The invite links may be dumped to the local disk to faciliate faster startup times and is deleted immeadiately after.  

Server configurations and all user invite data related to that server are stored permenantly until:
* A server admin resets the data by using the inbuilt command(s)
* The bot is kicked from / leaves the server. The data may be stored for upto a week longer (incase the bot was kicked by accident)

## Can I request deletion of the data that you have stored relating to me?

**Yes**, you may contact us at our [support server](https://discord.gg/uXbczw9aax) to request deletion of your data.  
This being said, it is possible to delete most of the data yourself by using the inbuilt command(s). If you are unsure how, you may consult the official documentation or ask for help in our [support server](https://discord.gg/uXbczw9aax).

## Final words

We may, at any time, and at our sole discretion, update or modify this document with or without prior notice.
